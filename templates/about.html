	<h2>EF English Proficiency Index Data (EPI)</h2>

	<p><b>Where did this data come from?</b></p>
  <p><b>Arab American Association</b></p>
  <p>Data regarding American attitudes towards American Arabs is taken from a report by the Arab American Institute (AAI). The report titled <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/aai/pages/11126/attachments/original/1450651184/2015_American_Attitudes_Toward_Arabs_and_Muslims.pdf?1450651184"><i>American Attitudes Towards Arabs and Muslims</i></a> was published in December 2015. Zogby Analytics was commissioned  by  AAI to  conduct an  online  survey  of  1001  adults  in  the U.S. Data presented is based on a confidence interval of 95%, the margin of error for 1001 is +/- 3.2 percentage  points. This data was complete, almost all information was maintained in the data and a clear methodology was presented. </p>
  <p><b>Modern Language Association</b></p>
  <p>Data regarding American college enrollment in Arabic language is taken from a report from the Modern Language Association analzying college student enrollment in languages other than English. The report, titled <a href="https://www.mla.org/Resources/Research/Surveys-Reports-and-Other-Documents/Teaching-Enrollments-and-Programs/Enrollments-in-Languages-Other-Than-English-in-United-States-Institutions-of-Higher-Education"><i>Enrollments in Languages Other Than English in United States Institutions of Higher Education</i></a>is very extensive with a clear methodoloy that presents trends in data through the decades. The report is part of a series, examining language learning in college insitutions since the 1960s. The data has some Completeness issues, as it only samples language learning at the college level. A clear picture of Arabic learning considering adult learning and pre-college learning is not possible through the study. However, it is still Coherent and Correct, considering that most language learning does occur at the university level.</p>
  <p><b>English Proficiency Index</b></p>
  <p>The primary set I examined comes from the EF English Proficiency Index, a report that ranks countries by their average level of English skills amongst young adults. The data set is produced by EF Education First, a global language training company. The data itself was collected from self-selected test participants that took an Education First English test over the internet. The tests are used by the company itself for marketing and placement purposes. To be included in the ranking, a country needed at least 400 test takers.The data isn't quite complete because not all Arab speaking countries are represented on the list.</p>
