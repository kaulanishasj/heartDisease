      <h2>Chest Pain and Angina</h2>
      <p>Angina is the pain you feel when one or more of your coronary arteries becomes damaged, blocked or narrowed and isn't able to bring enough oxygen-rich blood to your heart. The pain may occur during physical activity, exercise, stress, periods of extreme cold or hot temperatures, after heavy meals or while drinking alcohol or smoking.</p>
      <div> Chest Pain Type: 
         <li> Typical angina: Pressure, squeezing, burning, or tightness in the chest</li>

         <li> Non-anginal pain: Chest or other pain other than angina.</li>

      <h2>Blood Pressure</h2>
      <p>Blood pressure measures the force pushing outwards on your arterial walls. Over time, if the force of  blood flow is often high, the tissue that makes up the walls of arteries gets stretched beyond its healthy limit and damaged. This information is typically provided during general physical examinations.</p>

      <h2>Cholesterol</h2>
